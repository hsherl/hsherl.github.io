		<h2 class="c_minor">Teaching</h2>
		<p>I am a private tutor in mathematics, physics, and philosophy from GCSE and up to university level (depending on the specific topic). I am also a philosophy teacher with <a href="https://www.philosophy-foundation.org/specialist-philosophy-teachers#list-anchor">The Philosophy Foundation</a>.</p>

		<p>I am available for one-to-one tutoring in math, physics, and philosophy. Drop me a line at <a href="mailto:henrik.tutor@gmail.com">henrik.tutor@gmail.com</a> if you want help with any of these subjects.</p>

		<!-- <h2 class="c_minor">Studies</h2>
		<p>In addition to my teaching jobs, I am an undergraduate student at King’s College London, where I am studying for an MSci in Physics & Philosophy — which works out to about half and half physics and philosophy.</p>

		<p>My main interests in philosophy are epistemology, ethics, and meta-philosophy — which is to say: questioning the very project of philosophy itself, in all its incarnations.</p>

		<p>My interest in physics is focused on the ability of science to explain the world — how concepts like time, entropy, locality, and measurement can give us an understanding of how the world works (or: whether they do in fact give us anything like an understanding).</p> -->

		<!-- <h2 class="c_minor">About me</h2>
		<p>I grew up in Stavanger — a small town on the west coast of Norway. It’s pretty cold and wet up there, but it’s a beautiful and serene. When I was 19, I moved to Berkeley to study physics. It didn’t take me long to discover that the laboratory and I would never quite get along — and least not as well as I get along with theory.  Around the same time I was re-introduced to philosophy, which I fell in love with. On top of that, I faced the unfortunate fate of a declining exchange rate, making my loan in my home currency worth very little in US dollars. So, after a year at UC Berkeley, I moved to London — the place I now call home — to do both physics and philosophy at the same time.</p> -->
