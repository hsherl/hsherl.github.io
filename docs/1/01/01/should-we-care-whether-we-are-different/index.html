      <p>Crispin Sartwell wrote a scathing criticism in The New York Times of the tendency among Western Philosophers to search for a difference between animals and humans. Why is it so important to them that and how humans are different to squirrels? As he says: “if we truly believed we were so much better than squirrels, why have we spent thousands of years driving home the point?”</p>
<p>The obvious answer is that it matters to humans to know ourselves. And part of knowing ourselves is knowing what kind of animals we are and what makes us tick. Sartwell paints the question in an intellectualist light, but it need not be. We can, with Spinoza and Deleuze, wonder what our bodies can do. Or, with the existentialists, we can wonder what kind of meanings we can make for ourselves and how. With Aristotle, keeping a good ironic distance to his full system, we might wonder what is good for us as humans. The answer to each of these, and more besides, depends on what we can do. And what we can do, arguably, depends on our history.</p>
