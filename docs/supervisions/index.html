      <p>I have supervised undergraduate students at Cambridge since 2022. Below is a list of the subjects for which I have supervised along with the questions and reading lists I have set.</p>
<h2 id="subjects">Subjects</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="pom/">II Philosophy of mind</a> (II) (Michaelmas 2022)</li>
<li><a href="ethics/">1B Ethics</a> (1B) (Michaelmas 2022)</li>
<li><a href="economics/">HPS II Philosophy of economics</a> (Michaelmas 2022)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>
<ul>
<li>Your essay should be about 2,500 words and is due approximately 24 hours before the supervision.</li>
<li>You should make yourself familiar with all the primary readings. You do not need to read them all in depth, but it is your responsibility to allocate your time and resources properly&ndash;i.e to figure out which is the most and least important reading. This will involve skimming, googling, checking reference articles (on IEP, SEP, and even Wikipedia), and taking clear notes from the start. Let me know if you want to work through how to do this more effectively.</li>
<li>The full reading list for each paper can be found at: <a href="https://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/curr-students">https://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/curr-students</a>. It is not a good idea to read everything, but it is a good idea to be familiar with a representable sample of the list.</li>
<li>You can usually find the links to the readings through the reading list (on Moodle) or by typing them directly into iDiscover: <a href="https://www.idiscover.lib.cam.ac.uk">www.idiscover.lib.cam.ac.uk</a>. Google Scholar and PhilPapers are also helpful for this.</li>
<li>Former PhD students at Cambridge have made a essay writing guide which you should consult: <a href="https://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/curr-students/writing-skils/phil-essay-guide">https://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/curr-students/writing-skils/phil-essay-guide</a>.</li>
<li>Get in touch with questions or comments about the material or your essays (i.e. if you didn&rsquo;t understand a passage in an article or if you are not sure whether your outline works). You can do this either at the bottom of the essay or in your email to me. It&rsquo;s good to reflect on the process in the midst of it.</li>
<li>If you’re having trouble meeting the deadline or you will not be able to make the supervision,, then you must let me know ASAP.</li>
<li>When you are finished writing, email a .docx or .pages file to hrs53 at cam.ac.uk&ndash;or a .pdf if if you promise to format it nicely, with right-adjusted margins, a serif typeface, and double line-spacing.</li>
</ul>
