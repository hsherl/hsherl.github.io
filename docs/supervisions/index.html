      <p>These are supervision guides for undergraduate students at Cambridge, but are open to all supervisors and students to use as they wish.</p>

<h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>
<ul>
<li>Your essay of approximately 2,500 words is due approximately 24 hours prior to the time of our supervision. Please email it to me at hrs53 at cam.ac.uk as a .pdf file or .docx if you can’t do that.</li>
<li>Please do let me know if you’re struggling to locate any readings (e.g. physical books that are on loan to someone else) and I’ll try to help out.</li>
<li>Please do send any questions or comments you have about the material or your essays (e.g. ‘I didn’t understand this passage in this reading’ or ‘Does the way I structured my essay work?’), either at the bottom of the essay or in your email to me – it’s useful to be reflective about your own work, and for me to have an idea of what you’d find most useful to cover in the supervision.</li>
<li>An excellent resource for writing supervision essays is the following guide created by some former PhD students at Cambridge: <a href="https://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/curr-students/writing-skils/phil-essay-guide">https://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/curr-students/writing-skils/phil-essay-guide</a>.</li>
<li>The readings suggested below do not exhaust the topic. You may go beyond the list provided.</li>
<li>The full reading list for each paper can be found at: <a href="https://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/curr-students">https://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/curr-students</a>. It is not a good idea to read everything!</li>
<li>You can usually find the links to the readings through the reading list or by typing them directly into iDiscover: <a href="https://www.idiscover.lib.cam.ac.uk">www.idiscover.lib.cam.ac.uk</a>.</li>
<li>If you’re having trouble meeting the deadline, or you will not be able to make the supervision, please let me know ASAP so we can rearrange.</li>
