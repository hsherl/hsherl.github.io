      <p>I have supervised undergraduate students at Cambridge since 2022. Below is a list of the subjects for which I have supervised along with the questions and reading lists I have set.</p>
<h2 id="subjects">Subjects</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="pom/">II Philosophy of mind</a> (II) (Michaelmas 2022)</li>
<li><a href="ethics/">1B Ethics</a> (1B) (Michaelmas 2022)</li>
<li><a href="economics/">HPS II Philosophy of economics</a> (Michaelmas 2022)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>
<ul>
<li>Your essay should be about 2,500 words and is due approximately 24 hours before the supervision.</li>
<li>Email a .docx or .pages file to hrs53 at cam.ac.uk (or a .pdf if neither of those work, but please format it nicely!).</li>
<li>Let me know if you are struggling to find any of the readings and I’ll try to help out.</li>
<li>Get in touch with questions or comments about the material or your essays (i.e. if you didn&rsquo;t understand a passage in an article or if you are not sure whether your outline works). You can do this either at the bottom of the essay or in your email to me. It&rsquo;s good to reflect on the process in the midst of it.</li>
<li>It can be helpful to look at the guide created by some former PhD students at Cambridge: <a href="https://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/curr-students/writing-skils/phil-essay-guide">https://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/curr-students/writing-skils/phil-essay-guide</a>.</li>
<li>The full reading list for each paper can be found at: <a href="https://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/curr-students">https://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/curr-students</a>. It is not a good idea to read everything, but it is a good idea to be familiar with a representable sample of the list.</li>
<li>You can usually find the links to the readings through the reading list or by typing them directly into iDiscover: <a href="https://www.idiscover.lib.cam.ac.uk">www.idiscover.lib.cam.ac.uk</a>. Google Scholar can otherwise be helpful.</li>
<li>If you’re having trouble meeting the deadline or you will not be able to make the supervision, then please let me know ASAP so we can rearrange.</li>
</ul>
