      <p>How can the same carved piece of wood be a rook one day and yet be a mere carved piece of wood the day before? Something — someone, the chess players — in between makes the piece play the role as a rook. But what about the chess players themselves? What makes them able to make carved pieces of wood into chess pieces?</p>
<p>I am now <em>merely</em> a Norwegian citizen. But I am soon to be a British citizen. How can this change happen? Someone has to <em>let</em> me be a British citizen and then recognize me as one. But that means that I have to be recognizeable, at least in principle, as a British citizen. What is it to be recognizeable as such? What is it that makes someone able to recognize in such a way?</p>
<p>Rooks and citizenships can both be thought of as patterns, the chess players and the British as pattern-recognizers.</p>

<p>I really like this account of novelty as type-difference between sets of dependencies. Can screening-off be characterized as a kind of novelty too?</p>
<p>What I have in mind is something like this. Bosons and fermions are horizontally different to one another, because they exhibit different types of dependencies even though they operate in the same types of systems. Let’s call this diversity. Fermions and gases are instead vertically different, because they exhibit different types of dependencies in different types of systems. I take it that this is called novelty.</p>
<p>Then there is the meta-difference between diversity and novelty, which is crucial. The difference between ‘different dependency’ and ‘different system’ is key to emergence. Bosons could not be emergent from fermions, because their dependencies are not different in the right way.</p>
<p>Screening-off fails when the details of the lower-level dependencies matter to the higher-level dependencies. In the difference-lingo, screening-off thus fails when the novelty similar to the diversity—when the meta-difference is insignificant. The binary star system can itself be treated like a star in a binary star system. The diversity of the lower theory already allows such composites as in its cast of characters (just like a school play can treat two actors as one when they share the role of the donkey—nothing new is needed to incorporate them).</p>
<p>Screening-off succeeds when the details of the lower-level dependencies (mostly) do not matter to the higher-level dependencies. In the difference-lingo, screening-off thus succeeds when the novelty is different from the diversity—when the meta-difference is significant. The gas cannot be treated like a fermion, nor as member of a system of fermions. The diversity of QFT does not allow such composites as in its cast of characters (just like a school play cannot treat another play as an actor—something entirely new is needed to treat plays themselves (see Synechdoche New York)).</p>
<p>The difference-only account of emergence would then run like this: an entity is emergent iff it enters into macrodependencies that are both different and meta-different to the microdependencies. I.e., the macrodependencies must be both novel and have novel diversity.</p>
<p>(Placing type-difference at the very heart of emergence is sort of what Deleuzians would do, if I understand them correctly—perhaps an interesting bridge between continental and analytic philosophy can be forged here!)</p>
