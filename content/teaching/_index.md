I am currently teaching undergraduate [discussion groups](seminars/) and [supervisions](supervisions/) at Cambridge. 

Starting in Michaelmas 2022, I have supervised students in the following papers: 

- [Part IB Ethics](supervisions/ethics/)
- [Part II Philosophy of Mind](supervisions/pom/)
- [Part II Philosophy of Science](supervisions/pos/)
- HPS Part II Philosophy of Economics
- HPS Part II Ethical Issues in Psychiatry
<!-- - Part IB History of Analytic Philosophy -->
<!-- - Part IB Knowledge, Language, and World -->
<!-- - Part II Ethics --> 
<!-- - Part II Wittgenstein and his successors  -->
<!-- - Part II European Philosophy after Kant  -->

Since Lent 2023, I have led the following discussion groups (seminars): 

- [Part IB Ethics](seminars/ethics/)
- [Part IB The Epistemology and Metaphysics of Science](seminars/ems/)
<!-- - Part IA Set Texts -->
<!-- - Part IB History of Analytic Philosophy -->  

I am also a teaching assistant and supervisor for the Part IA Formal Methods paper. 

IA, IB, and II indicate the first, second, and third year of undergraduate studies. 

Papers in the Department of the History and Philosophy of Science have centrally designed reading lists and syllabi (accessible on Moodle), whereas papers in the Philosophy Faculty have a centrally designed reading list on the basis of which each supervisor makes their own syllabi (linked).
