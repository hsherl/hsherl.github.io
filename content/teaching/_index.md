I am currently teaching undergraduate [discussion groups](seminars/) and [supervisions](supervisions/) at Cambridge. 

In Michaelmas 2022, I supervised students in

- [ethics](supervisions/ethics/), 
- [philosophy of mind](supervisions/pom/), 
- [philosophy of science](supervisions/pos/), and
- [philosophy of economics](supervisions/poe/). 

In Lent 2023, I will lead discussion groups (seminars) on

- [ethics](seminars/ethics/) and
- [the epistemology and metaphysics of science](seminars/ems/).
