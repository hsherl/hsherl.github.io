I am currently teaching undergraduate [discussion groups](seminars/) and [supervisions](supervisions/) at Cambridge. 

I supervise (or have supervised) the following papers: 

- [Part IB Ethics](supervisions/ethics/)
- [Part IB Knowledge, Language, and World](supervisions/klw)
- [Part IB History of Analytic Philosophy](supervisions/hap/)
- [Part II Philosophy of Mind](supervisions/pom/)
- [Part II Philosophy of Science](supervisions/pos/)
- HPS Part II Philosophy of Economics (Moodle access only)
- HPS Part II Ethical Issues in Psychiatry (Moodle access only)
- [Part II Wittgenstein and His Successors](supervisions/wah/)
- [Part II Ethics](supervisions/iiethics/)
- [Part II European Philosophy after Kant](supervisions/epk/)

I also teach (or have taught) the following discussion groups (seminars): 

- Part IA Formal Methods (Moodle access only)
- Part IA Set Texts: Ethics and Political Philosophy (Moodle access only)
- [Part IB Ethics](seminars/ethics/)
- [Part IB The Epistemology and Metaphysics of Science](seminars/ems/)
- [Part IB History of Analytic Philosophy](seminars/hap/)

The linked syllabi have been curated from the Cambridge Faculty of Philosophy's [publicly available materials](https://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/curr-students/course-outlines-and-reading-lists), usually with help from PhD students who have taught them before. 

Teaching is important to me. I rely on student feedback both to detect my blindspots and improve and also to detect what is working so I can keep that going. If you are or have been my student, you may submit anonymous feedback [here](https://forms.gle/GkCDJrcPqpq2S4oL8) at any time. Alternatively, you can get in touch with me directly at *hrs53* at *cam.ac.uk*.

The letters IA, IB, and II refer respectively to the first, second, and third years of an undergraduate degree in philosophy at Cambridge. 

Papers in the Department of the History and Philosophy of Science have centrally designed reading lists and syllabi (accessible on Moodle), whereas papers in the Philosophy Faculty have a centrally designed reading list on the basis of which each supervisor makes their own syllabi (linked).
