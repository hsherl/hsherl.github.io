I will be teaching seminars for second year undergraduates at Cambridge starting in January 2023 on the following subjects: 

- [Part IB Epistemology and Metaphysics of Science](ems/) (Lent 2023)
- [Part IB Ethics](ethics/) (II) (Lent 2023)

Parts IA, IB, and II refer respectively to the first, second, and third years of an undergraduate degree in philosophy at Cambridge. 

Each weekly seminar targets a central paper in the subject. (Some weeks there are two papers.) The goal of the seminar is to discuss it with peers at a deeper level than the lecture does. That means that students must read ahead and take detailed notes. 

Reading lists can be found on the subject pages above. These may change during the term in response to suggestions or requests.
