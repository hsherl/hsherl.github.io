I teach or have taught seminars for second-year undergraduates at Cambridge in following subjects: 

- Part IA Set Texts: Ethics and Political Philosophy (Lent 2024)
- Part IA Formal Methods (Michaelmas 2022â€”)
- [Part IB Epistemology and Metaphysics of Science](ems/) (Lent 2023)
- [Part IB Ethics](ethics/) (Lent 2023)
- [Part IB History and Philosophy of Science](hap/) (Lent 2024)

Each weekly seminar targets a central paper in the subject. The goal is to discuss it with peers at a deeper level than the lecture can. That means that students must read ahead and take detailed notes. 

Reading lists can be found on the subject pages above. These may change during the term in response to suggestions or requests. 

The letters IA, IB, and II refer respectively to the first, second, and third years of an undergraduate degree in philosophy at Cambridge.
