*Week 7*: 

- Read the Preface to the Tractatus and this passage from Wittgenstein's 1919 letter to Ludwig Ficker, in which Wittgenstein wrote of the *Tractatus* that 

> [...] the point of the book is an ethical one. I once wanted to include in the preface a sentence that is now actually not there, but that I will write to you now since it might be a key for you: I wanted to write that my book consists of two parts: of the one that is present here and of everything I have not written. Precisely this second part is the important one. For the ethical is delimited as it were from the inside by my book; and I am convinced that strictly speaking it can ONLY be delimited in this way. In short I think: everything of which many nowadays are blethering, I have defined in my book by being silent about it [...]. I would recommend you to read the preface and the conclusion since they express the point most  directly
