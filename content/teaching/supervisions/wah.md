[Back to all supervision subjects](../).

Here are the topics, questions, and reading lists for the Part II Wittgenstein and His Successors supervisions in the Philosophy Tripos at Cambridge. Students must choose just one question per week when more than one is listed. 

# Austin

> 1. ‘But if we are prepared to admit that there may be… some cases in which “delusive and veridical perceptions” really are indistinguishable, does this admission require us to drag in, or even let in sense-data?’. Does it?
> 2. ‘If the performance of an illocutionary act requires the securing of uptake, it follows, absurdly, that anyone who does not get uptake for their attempt at refusing consent has in fact consented.’ Is this a good objection to Austin’s claim about uptake?
