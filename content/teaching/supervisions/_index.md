Supervisions are small-group discussions between a supervisor (me) and one, two, or sometimes three students. They involve an in-depth discussion of a piece of writing on an agreed topic, submitted 24 hours in advance for the supervisor to mark. Go [back](../) to the previous page to find syllabi for the papers I supervise. 

Key points: 

- The essay is due **24 hours before the supervision**. 
- It should be **at most 2,500 words**. 
- Submit to *hrs53* at *cam.ac.uk* either as a **pdf** typeset in **EB Garamond** with **line height 1.5**, **justified margins**, **font-size 12**, and **wide margins** with space for comments.[^1]

The essay should

- explain and frame what the question is getting at (in the introduction), 
- outline how the essay plans to answer the question (in the introduction), 
- signpost (make it clear to the reader what you are trying to do), 
- explain technical vocabulary,
- use the same words for the same things throughout, 
- give reasons for its claims, 
- use concrete examples to illustrate abstract ideas, 
- demonstrate familiary with the primary readings, 
- consider at least one central argument in depth, 
- consider at least one rebuttal, and
- **omit needless ideas**. 

The last point is perhaps the most important. The student must demonstrate both *that* and *how* what they say in the essay goes towards answering the essay question. They should treat the marker as if they were a peer who is studying a different course and needs to have everything explained from scratch. Extraneous parts count against the essay, even if they are interesting in their own right. Even a publishable argument will not lead to a good grade if it does not answer the question under discussion.

There are many ways to approach essays. Here is one step-by-step guide which can be useful for students who find it difficult to recall what they have read while writing. Students should modify this guide to fit their own ways of working. 

1. Read (only) the required papers in advance. 
    1. Practice identifying the key arguments and counterarguments. 
    2. Use questions from past exam papers to scaffold (1). These tell you what the course wants you to focus on. 
2. Go to the lecture. 
    1. Use the lecture as a map and compass that guides you, not as another text to cite and quote.
    2. Spend more time listening than note-taking.  
3. Choose a question. 
4. Skim an overview of the topic on the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy or the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. 
5. **Reading-writing**. Make a new document. Carefully read what *seems* like the most fruitful article for answering your question (3) based on what you have learned in (1), (2), and (4). 
    1. First, read the introduction and conclusion; then, read the rest of the essay. Write down a concise summary of the aims of the article. 
    2. While reading, start writing your own answer to the question,  following the structure of the paper you are reading. 
    3. While reading, quote key passages (along with page numbers) and write your own corresponding paraphrases (i.e. explain what the quotes mean). 
    5. Repeat (5.1-5.3) with another article. Use the same document in the second round. At the end, you will have a draft with a bad structure, but with all the quotes, references, and paraphrases you need. In addition, you will have written down the majority of your own thoughts. As a result, you will remember the reading better and have done more work before beginning the next stage. 
6. **Outlining**. Make a new document, in which you outline the general structure of the essay. Fill in outline elements with your notes, quotes, and paraphrases from (5). 
8. **Write-up**. Make a final document. On the basis of your outline document, write up the full essay. 

For extended essays it is expected that key passages and key articles have been read many times with careful attention to details.
