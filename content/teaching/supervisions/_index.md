I have supervised undergraduate students at Cambridge since 2022 in the subjects listed below. Parts IA, IB, and II refer respectively to the first, second, and third years of an undergraduate degree in philosophy at Cambridge.  

- [Part II Philosophy of Science](pos/) (Lent 2023)
- [Part II Philosophy of Mind](pom/) (Michaelmas 2022)
- [Part IB Ethics](ethics/) (Michaelmas 2022 and Lent 2023)
- [Philosophy of Economics](poe/) (Michaelmas 2022)

All supervisions share a core logistical structure: 

- The essay is due **24 hours before the supervision**. 
- It should be **at most 2,500 words**. 
- Get in touch at the earliest possible time if you can't make the deadline or the meeting. 
- Submit a **.docx** or **.pages** file to *hrs53* at *cam.ac.uk*. 

The essay should

- explain and frame what the question is getting at (in the introduction), 
- outline how the essay plans to answer the question (in the introduction), 
- signpost, 
- explain technical vocabulary, 
- use concrete examples to illustrate abstract ideas, 
- demonstrate familiary with the primary readings, 
- consider at least one central argument in depth, 
- consider at least one rebuttal, and
- omit needless ideas (i.e. ideas which do not clearly address the question). 

Some useful resources are

- the [library search service](https://idiscover.lib.cam.ac.uk/), 
- the faculty's [essay writing guide](https://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/curr-students/writing-skils/phil-essay-guide), and
- the faculty's reading lists for part [IA](https://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/curr-students/IA/IA-reading-lists), [IB](https://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/curr-students/IB/IB-reading-lists)), and [II](https://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/curr-students/II/II-reading-lists). 

There are many ways to approach essays. Here is one step-by-step guide. Students should modify it to their liking. 

1. Go to the lecture. 
2. Skim an overview of the topic on the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy or the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. 
3. Carefully read what *seems* like the most fruitful article based on (1) and (2). 
    1. Read the introduction and conclusion then the rest of the essay. 
    2. Take notes and save quotes (along with page numbers). 
    3. Write quick paraphrases of these quotes for later use and to build memory. 
    4. Note important references. 
4. Repeat (3) until enough articles have been covered. 
5. Outline the general structure of the essay. 
6. Fill in outline elements with quotes and paraphrases from (3) and (4). 
7. Write the full essay based on this detailed outline. 

For extended essays it is expected that key passages and key articles have been read many times with careful attention to details.
