Here are the topics, questions, and reading lists for the Part IB History of Analytic Philosophy supervisions in the Philosophy Tripos at Cambridge. Students must choose just one question per week when more than one is listed. One question must be comparative. This must involve the thinker which has not been covered by the other three choices. 

# Frege

## Primary material

- ‘On concept and object’ (1892)
- The Frege-Hilbert correspondence
- ‘Thoughts’ (1919)

## Questions

- 'The horse Bucephalus is an object, while the concept *horse* is a concept'. Why did Frege disagree? Was he right?

- Why did Russell aim to construct things from appearances? Did he succeed?

## Secondary material

# Wittgenstein

The primary material is the *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus* (1922). 

## Questions

- How realist is the Tractatus?
- ‘All propositions are of equal value.’ (TLP, 6.4) Discuss.
- ‘It is clear, however, that “A believes that p”, “A has the thought p”, and “A says p” are of the form “‘p’ says p”.’ (TLP, 5.542) Discuss.
- Critically assess Wittgenstein’s account of objects and their forms in the Tractatus.
- What remains when the ladder is thrown away?
- Is ethics nonsense? 

## Secondary material

# Ramsey

## Primary material

- ‘The foundations of mathematics’(1925)
- ‘Universals’ (1925)
- ‘Facts and propositions’ (1927)

## Questions

- Was Ramsey right to think there is ‘no separate problem of truth’?
- Was Ramsey correct to argue that no fundamental classification of objects can be based on the distinction between the subject and predicate of a proposition? 

## Secondary material

# Comparative

- Compare and contrast Frege’s and Russell’s accounts of empty singular
terms such as ‘Sherlock Holmes’. 
- Can Russell’s Gray’s Elegy argument be made to work against the Fregean notion of sense?
- Compare the views on the particular/universal distinction of two or more of the authors set for this paper.
- Compare the views on identity of two or more of the authors set for this paper.
- What did Wittgenstein think was wrong with Russell’s multiple relation theory of judgment? Was Wittgenstein’s own theory any better?
