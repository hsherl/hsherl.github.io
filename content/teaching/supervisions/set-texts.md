Here are the topics, questions, and reading lists for the Part IA Set texts supervisions in the Philosophy Tripos at Cambridge. Students must choose just one question per week when more than one is listed. Since there are three thinkers for the four weeks, students must choose two questions from one of them. 

The extended reading list with secondary readings can for the moment be found on Moodle. 

# Plato's *Meno*

- ‘Socrates is only vulnerable to the paradox of inquiry because he insists, absurdly, that one must know the definition of something before one can know anything else about it.’ Discuss.
- ‘Socrates leaves it entirely unclear what is involved in “reasoning out the cause”, because his discussion consists entirely of obscure examples and analogies.’ Is this a fair charge?
- How seriously should we take the proposal that virtue comes to us as a gift from the gods?

# Descartes's *Meditations*

- ‘I realized that it was necessary, once in the course of my life, to demolish everything completely and start again right from the foundations.’ (DESCARTES) Why did Descartes believe this demolition was necessary? Focusing on one sceptical argument in the First Meditation, describe and evaluate his attempt to ‘demolish everything’.
- Is the cogito an inference? Did Descartes think it was?
- What is Descartes’s best argument for substance dualism?
- How successful are the Meditations in providing a firm foundation for the
sciences?
- In what sense, if any, are Descartes’s Meditations meditations?

# Mill's *On Liberty* and *The Subjection of Women*

- Would Mill have supported the various restrictions on liberty imposed in relation to Covid-19?
- ‘The state may have compelling reason to restrict certain highly offensive nuisances, even when they are harmless.’ How might Mill respond to this statement?
- Does Mill give us enough reason to think that free speech promotes the discovery of truth?
- ‘I deny that any one knows, or can know, the nature of the two sexes, as long as they have only been seen in their present relation to one another.’ (MILL) Assess this statement, bringing out its political and philosophical implications.
