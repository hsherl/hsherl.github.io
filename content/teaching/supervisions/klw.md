Here are the topics, questions, and reading lists for the Part IB Knowledge, Language, and World supervisions in the Philosophy Tripos at Cambridge. Students must choose just one question per week when more than one is listed. 

## 1 Modality

Questions: 

> 1. What would it mean for modality to be a fiction?
> 2. 'When I say that Hilary Clinton might have won, I mean that *she* might have won, not that someone like her might have won. Therefore, Lewis's modal realism is false.' Is this a good argument?

# 2 Truth

Question: 

> 1. What would we lose if we couldn’t talk about truth?
> 2. Many theories of truth hold that ‘Eating people is wrong’ is equivalent to ‘“Eating people is wrong” is true’. Are such theories committed to thinking that moral realism is trivially true?
> 3. What should a correspondence theory of truth make truth correspond to?
> 4. Is there any more to understanding truth than understanding that ‘p’ is true iff p?

# 3 Knowledge

Question: 

> 1. Can truth-tracking conditions, such as safety or sensitivity, provide the basis for a successful analysis of knowledge?
> 2. Is knowledge unanalyzable? If yes, how? If not, how should it be understood?
> 3. What, if anything, do Gettier cases teach us about the nature of knowledge?
> 4. What would be lost if we attributed true belief in place of knowledge?

# 4 Scepticism

Question: 

> 1. Can we avoid scepticism by ignoring it?
> 2. Should the internalist be more troubled than the externalist by scepticism?
> 3. ‘The sceptical arguments show that the concept “knowledge” is incoherent and should be abandoned or replaced.’ Discuss
> 4. What is a more convincing approach to refuting scepticism: contextualism or denying closure?
> 5. Is the Moorean response to scepticism effective?
