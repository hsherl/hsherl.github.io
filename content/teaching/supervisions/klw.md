[Back to all supervision subjects](../).

Here are the topics, questions, and reading lists for the Part IB Knowledge, Language, and World supervisions in the Philosophy Tripos at Cambridge. Students must choose just one question when more than one is listed. Only four topics will be covered. 

*Draft. 

## 1 Possible worlds

Questions: 

> 1. What would it mean for modality to be a fiction?
> 2. 'When I say that Hilary Clinton might have won, I mean that *she* might have won, not that someone like her might have won. Therefore, Lewis's modal realism is false.' Is this a good argument?

# 4 Scepticism

Question:

> 2. Should the internalist be more troubled than the externalist by scepticism?

# 5 Truth

Question: 

> 1. What would we lose if we couldn’t talk about truth?
> 2. Many theories of truth hold that ‘Eating people is wrong’ is equivalent to ‘“Eating people is wrong” is true’. Are such theories committed to thinking that moral realism is trivially true?

# 7 Primary and Secondary Qualities

>  1. 'Primary qualities resemble the ideas they produce in our minds, whereas secondary qualities do not.' Is this a satisfactory way of drawing the primary-secondary quality distinction?
