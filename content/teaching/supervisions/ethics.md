Here are the topics, questions, and reading lists for the Part IB Ethics supervisions in the Philosophy Tripos at Cambridge. Students must choose just one question when more than one is listed. Only four topics will be covered. 

## 1 Practical reason

Questions: 

> 1. ‘If people’s reasons for action depend on their desires, then people without at least some desire to be good have no reason to be good. So, people’s reasons for action don’t depend on their desires.’ Is this a good argument?
> 2. ‘You are obligated to $\varphi$ only if you have reason to $\varphi$. You have reason to $\varphi$ only if you are motivated to $\varphi$. You are not motivated to $\varphi$; therefore, you are not obligated to $\varphi$.’ Discuss.

- Kieran Setiya, 'Against Internalism'.

## 2 Early modern moral philosophy

Questions: 

> 1. What grounds the normative authority of morality? Answer with reference to early modern voluntarism and rationalism.
> 2. Leibniz and Spinoza both disagree with voluntarism. Are their reasons for doing so compatible? Are they right? 

At the moment (2022-2023), Spinoza is not examinable. You may still choose to read him and answer the second question, but should expect to do this on top of the primary readings.
