Here are the topics, questions, and reading lists for the Part II European Philosophy after Kant supervisions in the Philosophy Tripos at Cambridge. Students must choose just one question per week when more than one is listed. Since there are three thinkers for the four weeks, students must choose two questions from one of them. 

The reading lists for Hegel and Nietzsche will be posted here soon. In the meantime they are available on Moodle. 

# Kant

The key text is Kant's *Critique of Pure Reason*, written in 1781 (A version) and revised in 1787 (B version). The translation by Guyer and Wood is my favourite: 

- Kant, I. (1998) *Critique of Pure Reason*. Cambridge, Cambridge University Press. Translated by P Guyer and A. W. Wood. [[iDiscover](https://idiscover.lib.cam.ac.uk/permalink/f/5hbpu5/44CAM_ALMA51528004650003606)]

Note that the text sometimes mashes together the A and B versions (when they match) and sometimes keeps them separate (when they don't). Always read both versions! 

You may also use the Norman Kemp-Smith or Jonathan Bennett translations.

Please read all of Sebastian Gardner's guidebook to Kant and the *Critique*: 

- Gardner, S. (1999) *Routledge Philosophy Guidebook to Kant and the Critique of Pure Reason*. London, Routledge. [[iDiscover](https://idiscover.lib.cam.ac.uk/permalink/f/1nb04c1/TN_cdi_askewsholts_vlebooks_9780203015483)].

Please also read all of the lecture notes available on Moodle. Consult these while figuring out what to read; see below for more. 

Since Kant is fond of using familiar words in unfamiliar ways, you will need to have a dictionary handy: 

- Caygill, H. (1995) *A Kant Dictionary*. Oxford, Blackwell. [[iDiscover](https://idiscover.lib.cam.ac.uk/permalink/f/5hbpu5/44CAM_ALMA51557579140003606)].
- Wuerth, J. (ed.) (2021) *The Cambridge Kant Lexicon*. Cambridge, Cambridge University Press. [[iDiscover](https://idiscover.lib.cam.ac.uk/permalink/f/t9gok8/44CAM_ALMA51656914040003606)].

Look up the concepts that confuse you *and* those you use in your essays, even if you think you understand them. 

The Cambridge companion is also incredibly useful for finding the best commentary: 

- Guyer, P. (ed.). *The Cambridge Companion to Kant*. Cambridge, Cambridge University Press. [[iDiscover](https://idiscover.lib.cam.ac.uk/permalink/f/16u99e0/44CAM_ALMA51531519560003606)].

To get to grips with Kant's transcendental idealism it might be worth delving into Allais' recent book: 

- Allais, L. (2015) *Manifest Reality: Kant’s Idealism and His Realism*. Oxford, Oxford University Press. [[iDiscover](https://idiscover.lib.cam.ac.uk/permalink/f/1ii55o6/44CAM_ALMA51531774190003606)].

It might also be useful to consult Longuenesse's book on the transcendental analytic (Pt. II. Div. I. of the Critique):  

- Longuenesse, B. (1998) *Kant and the Capacity to Judge: Sensibility and Discursivity in the Transcendental Analytic of the Critique of Pure Reason*. Princeton, Princeton University Press. [[iDiscover](https://idiscover.lib.cam.ac.uk/permalink/f/tdhsmj/44CAM_ALMA51635553490003606)].

Note that, with the exception of Gardner's guidebook, you are not expected to read any these books in full. It is impossible to do that without sacrificing attention to detail. Instead you should focus on the themes and sections that are covered in the lectures: 

1. Prefaces and introductions (Avii-Axxii, Bvii-
read these carefully, in full)
2. Transcendental aesthetic (A19-A49/B33-B73)
3. Transcendental deduction (A84-A130/B117-B169)
4. First analogy (A177-A189/B218-B232)
5. Second analogy (A189-A211/B232-B256)
6. Phenomena, Noumena, and the ‘Problem of Affection’ (A236-A260/B294-B315)
7. Refutations of idealism (A227-A235/B275-B287)
8. Kant’s Idealism and Primary/Secondary Qualities 

The list of topics is quite general and does not map onto the Critique or the secondary readings in an obvious way. Below is a more detailed, topic-ordered list of what you **must** read from the *Critique* along with the key secondary material which it is *strongly recommended* that you read:

The *Critique* has four parts: the prefaces, the introductions, the *Transcendental Doctrine of Elements*, and the *Transcendental Doctrine of Method*. You will be reading the first two and most of the third.   

The *Doctrine of Elements* has *parts* (Pt.), which divide into *divisions* (Div.), which divide into *books* (Bk.), which divide into *chapters* (Ch.), which divide into *sections* (for which I use '§'), which sometimes divide into subsections (no marks), which sometimes divide into subsubsections (no marks):

[^1]: The section numbers for this and the previous section were added in the second (B) edition and are rather confusing, so I leave them out here, sticking with the first (A) edition where possible. I have also varied the level of detail quite haphazardly to make the outline more readable and fit for the exam questions. 

Typical exam questions are as follows:  

- ‘Geometry is a science which determines the properties of space synthetically, and yet a priori.’ Discuss.
- ‘The analytical unity of apperception is only possible under the presupposition of some synthetic one.’ Analyse this claim and explain its significance for Kant's argument in the Transcendental Deduction.
- Did Kant succeed in answering Hume on cause and effect?
- In what sense, if any, can I know myself? Analyse and evaluate Kant’s answer.

When you write your essay you must cite the translation you are using and the **paragraph marks** you are referring to: cite 'Kant 1998 Axvii', *not* 'Kant 1781 p. 102'. That way I can find the same spot in my translation even if it cuts the pages differently. 

# Hegel

- Is Hegel a realist?
- Why does Hegel describe sense-certainty as both the ‘richest’ and the ‘poorest’ kind of knowledge? Is he right?
- Must Hegelian recognition be reciprocal? Must it be egalitarian?
- Examine and evaluate Hegel’s use of dialectic in his analysis of ‘being’ and ‘nothingness’.
- Examine and evaluate Hegel’s use of dialectic in his analysis of ‘lord’ and ‘bondsman’.
- ‘Hegel’s theory of freedom is intelligible only in the context of his metaphysics.’ Discuss.

# Nietzsche

- How would you convince Nietzsche that you are not a slave?
- ‘What is good? – Everything that enhances people’s feeling of power, will to power, power itself.’ Discuss.
- Can genealogy be philosophical?
- Does the genealogy of a belief make a difference to the truth of that belief? Answer with reference to Nietzsche.
- Should we accept Nietzsche’s claim that ‘only that which has no history can be defined’?
- If ‘slaves’ are as pathetic as Nietzsche depicts them to be, then how did it happen that slave morality triumphed over master morality?
- Why does Nietzsche think we must ‘become’ who we ‘are’? Is this doctrine coherent?
