## Rant to Ariel: 

I was listening to Metallica the other day in the car and I had an idea for an essay or somethign

it made me think like what if I could get an interview with James Hetfield, hahaha

because I was listening to this bonus edition of their latest album, where they include a bunch of live songs from their older albums

and it struck me that the new lyrics aren’t as angry anymore, the despair is gone, and they feel the need to throw in ridiculous shit like cthulu and ”lords of summer” and so on

and so I started wondering, is this a thing? has popular music gotten less angry? has it become more depressive, anxious, etc — maybe because it has become more reflective?

and that has made me kinda tempted to fiddle with an essay about societal anger management issues reflected by a general decline in heavy metal lyrics

which in turn I’m now sorta trying to relate to incels, misogyny, and rationalism…

this will probably go nowhere but I think if it did go somewhere, it should start almost exactly like DFW’s essay about porn

and then like, go to a heavy metal convention and interview people

so it’d be a fucking ton of work

impossible work in this time

yeah and I think that the Psyche piece on anger, as well as films like Inside Out, and lots of other pop culture and media about anger is like trying to take the taboo out of anger *by* saying that it’s a useful emotion — but useful only insofar as understanding it means we get to be happy and not angry anymore

metal is actually more popular now than ever and growing at that, but the lyrics are softening, the taboo is almost gone, and there is no edge left

and that means the anger isn’t really despairing anymore

so I guess that relates to Thomas’s thing about taboos and Bataille

Henrik Sherling, [3 Mar 2021 at 14:30:55]:
and I would really fucking love to ask James Hetfield if he thinks it is even possible to write Master of Puppets today

or Fade to Black

Henrik Sherling, [3 Mar 2021 at 14:31:24]:
because those are really fucking angry, but nothing today is, instead it’s aiming for new taboos, satanic stuff in black metal, etc

but that’s just fake taboo

Henrik Sherling, [3 Mar 2021 at 14:32:28]:
and basically the incel link comes at this junction: rap can be, often is, angry, but the people who now have no space for their anger is therefore white people

white men specifically

Henrik Sherling, [3 Mar 2021 at 14:34:07]:
Could you see Metallica fans of the 80s being incels? Only if we let “see” mean see them as born in the 90s or later, as opposed to seeing them be incels in the 80s

so there’s a Hacking thesis there too, about the possibility of becoming an incel being historically contingent

predicated, perhaps, on the loss of the metal taboo — predicated on watering out anger with utility
