So we both had some ideas when we where 16 that I think we need to talk about.

How did it start for you?

For me it started with Stephen Fry, I think, or maybe it was Hitchens. I must have watched hundreds of hours on YouTube of him and others destroying the believers, or whatever they called it. In this case it was to Ann Widdicombe at Intelligence Squared. Fry said that to take advice about sex from Catholic priests was like taking advice about food from people with anorexia or from those who are morbidly obese. I suppose those kinds of sizzling remarks played a huge role for me.
