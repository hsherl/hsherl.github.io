Lee Smolin has argued for an altogether different kind of multiverse than the one we see in popular science. The hypothesis is that the laws of nature themselves have evolved through a natural selection of universes, of which there were many, and of which there is now (at least) our universe. Stable tendencies in the universes are preferred by the selection process, just like they are in evolution within each universe. 

An obvious early problem is what exactly is doing the *selecting*. Natural selection is selection by natural circumstances. But natural circumstances are the kind of things that can occur within the universe. For Smolin’s idea to work, there have to be analogous circumstances in the multiverse-realm as well, beyond any individual universe. Such circumstances are needed to supply the friction that selects for stable tendencies. Indeed, such circumstances define the very idea of a stable tendency by providing the friction relative to which such tendencies can exhibit stability-in-this-way or stability-in-that-way. Organisms that are stable in the sea are not stable on land, and so on. The same should be true for the multiverses themselves. But now the question repeats itself: whence the friction that drives the evolution of multiverses?
