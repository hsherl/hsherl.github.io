How can the same carved piece of wood be a rook one day and yet be a mere carved piece of wood the day before? Something — someone, the chess players — in between makes the piece play the role as a rook. But what about the chess players themselves? What makes them able to make carved pieces of wood into chess pieces?

I am now *merely* a Norwegian citizen. But I am soon to be a British citizen. How can this change happen? Someone has to *let* me be a British citizen and then recognize me as one. But that means that I have to be recognizeable, at least in principle, as a British citizen. What is it to be recognizeable as such? What is it that makes someone able to recognize in such a way?

Rooks and citizenships can both be thought of as patterns, the chess players and the British as pattern-recognizers.
