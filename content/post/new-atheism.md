Sam Harris (on episode #243 of his podcast Making Sense): “Many people are confused about some of the views I express on this podcast … I get the sense that many Making Sense listeners don’t know where I’m coming from”. A remarkable confession that he is not living up to his own title. “There are certain things I actually understand about my own mind and about the mind in general—and the idea that racial identity is something we can’t get past is total bullshit. Insights into the nature of mind can’t help but touch politics.”

Gervais: “What are dreams for? […] Are they for anything?”

Harris: “Dreams are for the same thing as fingers, you’re just using them wrong.”
