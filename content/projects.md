Sunset at Storavatnet.

Here are some things I have worked on lately:

- At King’s College London:
  - I co-organized reading groups with the [Philosophy Society](https://www.kclsu.org/organisation/Philosophy/) about the [philosophy of mental disorder](https://www.kclsu.org/organisation/Philosophy/) (joint with the [Psychiatry Society](https://www.facebook.com/kclpsychsoc)), the epistemology of peer disagreement, and the philosophy of Alexander Bogdanov.
  - I co-wrote the class materials for a graduate class about Dark Matter (7CCP4935)
  - I presented a paper, a cohort study by Brown et. al. on the use of the Mental Health Act (2005) in the South London and Maudsley Trust, for the [Psychiatry Society](https://www.facebook.com/kclpsychsoc)’s journal club
- I have presented introductory talks for upper secondary school classes about the philosophy of science, epistemology of peer disagreement, philosophy of language, philosophy of mathematics, Pyrrhonian skepticism, and the philosophy of time travel
- I refereed philosophy papers for [Dialexicon Journal](https://www.dialexicon.org)
- I have translated English to Norwegian for [Practical Health Psychology](https://practicalhealthpsychology.com)

Do not hesitate to [get in touch](/contact/) if you or someone you know is looking for help with similar projects. I am currently looking for a job, so reach out to me or share this page with someone you know if you think I could be a suitable candidate.
