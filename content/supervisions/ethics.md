## 1 Practical reason

Choose one question: 

> 1. ‘If people’s reasons for action depend on their desires, then people without at least some desire to be good have no reason to be good. So, people’s reasons for action don’t depend on their desires.’ Is this a good argument?
> 2. ‘You are obligated to $\varphi$ only if you have reason to $\varphi$. You have reason to $\varphi$ only if you are motivated to $\varphi$. You are not motivated to $\varphi$; therefore, you are not obligated to $\varphi$.’ Discuss.

## 2 Early modern moral philosophy

Question: 

> 1. What grounds the normative authority of morality? Answer with reference to early modern voluntarism and rationalism.
> 2. Leibniz and Spinoza both disagree with voluntarism. Are their reasons for doing so compatible? Are they right? 

At the moment, Spinoza is not examinable. You may still choose to read him and answer the second question, but should expect to do this on top of the primary readings.

## 6 Virtue 

Virtue is a central ethical concept. This section examines the nature of virtue. One important debate concerns how
best to understand Aristotle’s influential account of virtue as consisting in a ‘mean’ between extremes. Another, also originating in Aristotle, concerns the question to what extent virtues are unified. Another concerns whether recent work in social psychology shows that there are no virtues in agents like us, as there are no stable character traits.
