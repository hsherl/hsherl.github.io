**Values in science collaboration**

A collaborative project with Benjamin Chin-Yee, in which we attempt to address what Bennett Holman and Torsten Wilholt have called 'The new demarcation problem' in science. This is the problem of demarcating legitimate value-ladenness in scientific judgment and communication. The project has so far resulted in two presentations and papers: 

- Making room for trust: against ‘explainable AI’. Objectivity, values, and trust workshop. November 30, 2023. University of Cambridge.
- Clinical Communication: A Model for Scientific Assertion? 8th Stockholm Graduate Conference. December 7, 2023; Bergen Philosophy of Science Workshop. October 23, 2023; and the Cambridge-MCMP Workshop. September 23, 2023.
