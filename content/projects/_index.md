**Human kinds and looping effects**

My thesis concerns how we represent kinds of people or human kinds in the human sciences, with a special focus on psychiatry and psychology. 

**Papers**

- Interactive disease kinds. (Manuscript). Presented: EENPS 5th Biennial Conference. Jagiellonian University, Kraków. 
- Valus and psychiatric categories. (Manuscript). Presented: Serious Metaphysics Group. May 23, 2024. University of Cambridge. 

**Values in science**

A collaborative project with Benjamin Chin-Yee, in which we attempt to address what Bennett Holman and Torsten Wilholt have called 'The new demarcation problem' in science. This is the problem of demarcating legitimate value-ladenness in scientific judgment and communication. The project has so far resulted in two presentations and papers: 

- Making room for trust: against ‘explainable AI’. (Under review). Presented: Objectivity, values, and trust workshop. November 30, 2023. University of Cambridge; Values in science reading group. May 29, 2024. University of Cambridge. 
- Clinical Communication: A Model for Scientific Assertion? (Manuscript). Presented: 8th Stockholm Graduate Conference. December 7, 2023; Bergen Philosophy of Science Workshop. October 23, 2023; and the Cambridge-MCMP Workshop. September 23, 2023.
