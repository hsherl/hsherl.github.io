In my research, I’ve focused on the methodology of the philosophy of science. My MSci dissertation concerned the methods that philosophers of science use to interpret quantum mechanics, with a particular focus on David Wallace’s Everettian, Many-Worlds interpretation and on scientific realism in fundamental physics. This was a particular instance of a broader theme, which includes how we acquire, use, create, and link scientific concepts and theories (among themselves as well as with ordinary concepts). I have spent a lot of time grappling with Willard Quine, Daniel Dennett, Donald Davidson, John Haugeland, and Ludwig Wittgenstein’s views about interpretation and representation—sometimes veering into the philosophy of language, other times into the philosophy of mathematics.

A key aspect to this theme is how scientific concepts and theories connect to ordinary concepts and common-sense attitudes. Do we make our scientific concepts out of our ordinary ones? This is hardly plausible in the case of the infamously unintuitive quantum mechanics. Then again: if quantum concepts are not at all connected to ordinary concepts, then how could we possibly understand them? Here I am particularly curious about the works of Rudolf Carnap and Ernst Cassirer, who were both interested (in very different ways) in the role of correspondence principles and correlative definitions in giving meaning to our theoretical terms. I am generally of the view, inspired by the works of Michael Friedman and Thomas Ryckman, that there is much to be gained in the contemporary philosophy of science from another look at the predecessors, contemporaries, and members of the Vienna Circle.

I’ve also spent much of my spare time studying contemporary phenomenology, especially as it engages with the fundamental concepts that structure experience—and the ways in which these structures can break down, as studied in phenomenological psychopathology. This is the flip side to the issue of theoretical meaning in science, namely how to understand the very idea of “giving meaning” to something in the first place.

I have puzzled a lot about the idea that patterns (of meaning in a theory) are constituted by the stance we take (towards the terms of that theory). This is an idea that we find not only in Dennett’s heterophenomenology (which opposes the kind of phenomenology that I am interested in) and David Wallace’s philosophy of physics, but also in the broader philosophy of science, particularly after Baas van Fraassen’s _The Empirical Stance_ (2002). A stance is what makes a pattern (of meaning, say) stand out from a background of (meaningless) noise and, as such, allows us to make sense of something, such as a theory, a term, a bar code, a behavior, and so on. Stances are clusters of commitments, attitudes, beliefs, habits, and (arguably) correspondence principles that make possible the pattern-noise (or sense-nonsense) distinction. But since different stances ground this distinction differently, there cannot be any final say in which stance is the _right_ stance—since such rightness itself can only come up within a stance.

This kind of talk assigns a peculiar role for noise (nonsense) as a sort of ground for the pattern (sense); and a yet more peculiar role of the stance itself as a ground of the pattern-noise distinction itself. One simply takes a stance and then the rest follows. But then what _is_—and what is it to _take_—a stance?

The above is, at best, a sketch and, for certain, far too speculative—and certainly none of it is very original, if at all. I will be grateful for any and all comments and suggestions and am more than happy to chat about it.
