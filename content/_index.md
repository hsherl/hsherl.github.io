I will begin a PhD in philosophy this autumn (2022) at St. John's College, Cambridge, with funding from Gates Cambridge. My thesis concerns looping effects in psychiatry and falls within the philosophy of medicine. Before this I studied for an MSci in Physics and Philosophy at Kingâ€™s College London, focusing on foundational problems in quantum mechanics.
