In the autumn of this year (2022) I will begin a PhD in philosophy at St. John's College, Cambridge, with funding from Gates Cambridge. My thesis concerns looping effects in psychiatry and falls within the philosophy of medicine. 

Before this I studied for an MSci in Physics and Philosophy at King’s College London, focusing on foundational problems in quantum mechanics. 

I am a member of the training team at [The Philosophy Foundation](https://www.philosophy-foundation.org/training-team) and have previously worked, at various times, as a philosophy, science, or Norwegian teacher.
