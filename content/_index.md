In the autumn of this year (2022) I will begin a PhD in philosophy at St. John's College, Cambridge, with funding from Gates Cambridge. My thesis concerns looping effects in psychiatry and falls within the philosophy of medicine. Before this I studied for an MSci in Physics and Philosophy at Kingâ€™s College London, focusing on foundational problems in quantum mechanics.
