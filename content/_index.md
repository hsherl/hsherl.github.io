Sunrise in Tasta.

I have an MSci in Physics and Philosophy from Kingâ€™s College London. I am currently training to teach science and physics in secondary schools. I tutor mathematics, physics, and philosophy on the side. I am also part of the training team at [The Philosophy Foundation](https://www.philosophy-foundation.org/training-team).
