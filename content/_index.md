Sunrise in Tasta.

I have an MSci in Physics and Philosophy from King’s College London and am currently training to teach science and physics in secondary schools. I’m also part of the training team at [The Philosophy Foundation](https://www.philosophy-foundation.org/training-team). [Click here](/about/) for more about my work and my philosophical interests.
