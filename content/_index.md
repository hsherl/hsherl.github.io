I am a PhD student in philosophy at St. John's College, Cambridge. My thesis is going to be about classification systems in psychiatry. I am also interested in philosophy of science more broadly, as well as in the gray areas between metaphysics, epistemology, and the philosophy of language. I have an MSci in Physics and Philosophy at Kingâ€™s College London, which focused on foundational problems in quantum mechanics.
