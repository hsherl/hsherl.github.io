Sunrise in Tasta.

I recently graduated with an MSci in Physics and Philosophy from King’s College London. I’m currently tutoring philosophy and mathematics for a living. I am looking for other work, particularly if it involves philosophy, writing, or teaching. [Contact me](/contact) if you have a relevant opportunity.
